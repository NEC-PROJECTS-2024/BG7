### INTRODUCTION
The banking industry is actively seeking to take use of the potential provided by contemporary technologies in order to improve their procedures, boostproduction, and save expenses, just like many other commercial endeavors.Conventional credit evaluation techniques frequently target underprivileged populations unfairly, hence sustaining socioeconomic inequalities. By implementing machine learning (ML)-driven models, banks may eliminate prejudices and provide more equitable lending access, enabling people and companies from all backgrounds.
